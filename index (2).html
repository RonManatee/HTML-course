            I am a full stack developer student devoted to learn as much as I can about fullstack coding to enhance learning.
            I am learning all that I can to become a valued member of a coding team. With my previous skills added to my new skillset,
            I believe there is nothing I cannot achieve.

          Aaron was an extreemly skilled asset to our development team. 
          He is a fast learner, catching up to speed with the rest of his team in a minimal amount of time.
          His skillset, mixed with the skills of the other team members allowed them to achieve the set deadline ahead of time.

          Aaron's attention to detail provided us a much needed outside view of our project. 
          Having his fresh input on our almost completed project showed us the minor errors within our code. 
          This new look saved us time and money as the errors caught would have delayed the deployment of our project.

          Working along side Aaron was complex. While we did not always see 'eye to eye', he was understanding and level headed.\
          When there were differences of opinon, Aaron would always try to see the isse from both sides of the arguement, then settling on the best outcome for the project.
          Having someone who is willing to have difficult conversations with was a breath of fresh air.
